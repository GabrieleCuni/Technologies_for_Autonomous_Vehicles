# Technologies_for_Autonomous_Vehicles
This repository stores the projects done during the optional course of Technologies for Autonomous Vehicle which is intended to introduce the concepts and technologies supporting autonomous driving and autonomous vehicles. Some concepts tackled during the lectures are: mechanical aspects related to the dynamics of a ground vehicle, vehicle dynamic control, sensors, computing platforms and algorithms for autonomous vehicles. 

During the course two group projects and one individual project were carried out.
The individual one was a lane detection software able to recognize the lane lines given pictures from a front vehicle camera.  
Scope of the first group project was to design a Simulink model able to simulate a scenario in which a vehicle equipped with an Adaptive Cruise Control system would automatically manage the acceleration in response to the presence of another vehicle ahead.
The second group project objective was to design a Simulink model able to simulate a simplified scenario in which 4 equidistant vehicles are joining to form a platoon which is a group of vehicles that can travel very closely together, safely at high speed.
